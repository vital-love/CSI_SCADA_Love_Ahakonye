Intrusion detection and classification schemes in the industrial Internet of Things involve artificial intelligence approaches. However, the stability of these approaches needs attention. This work uses the characteristics stability index (CSI) to determine machine learning model stability. The evaluated decision trees demonstrate reliability with more CSI threshold values of $1$ across compared datasets, indicating their validity for intrusion detection.
